            <h3><b><i>In 1666, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb invited Shivaji and his son Sambhaji to Agra, ostensibly for peace talks. But when they arrived, Shivaji realized it was a trap-as Aurangzeb placed him under house arrest in the Raja Jai Singh's haveli. To execute his escape, Shivaji feigned illness and started sending out large baskets of sweets to be distributed as offerings to holy men. These baskets were despatched from the fort routinely on the ground of charity. On the night of August 17, 1666, Shivaji and his son disguising themselves in two such baskets were carried out of the fort by his dedicated followers. In Shivaji Maharaj's daring escape from Agra, his follower, Hiroji Farzand, took his place in the haveli of Raja Jai Singh to mislead the Mughal guards. Outside, Shivaji disguised himself as a beggar and escaped the Mughal subjugated territory, back to the safety of his Maratha kingdom. This daring escape disgracefully shamed Aurangzeb and added to Shivaji's prestige as an astute tactician.</i></b></h3>
